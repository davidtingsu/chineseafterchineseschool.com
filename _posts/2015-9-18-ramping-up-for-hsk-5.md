# Goal Recap
Let’s recap on [my goals for 2015]({% post_url 2015-3-05-hsk-4-and-5-impressions-and-2015-goals %}):

1.  **FAIL** Read [Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone](http://www.kanunu8.com/files/writer/590.html) by June 2015 (with audiobook if possible)
2.  **FAIL** Read a [Giddens Ko book](http://www.kanunu8.com/files/writer/189.html) by September 2015 (with audiobook if possible)

    **Thoughts**: Although, I didn’t get a chance to read [九把刀’s books](http://www.kanunu8.com/files/writer/189.html), I did happen to watch 等一个人咖啡 (Cafe Waiting Love) and got to meet and listen to [Giddens talk about his life and journey as a writer](https://www.facebook.com/events/363855367139234/). <br>
    I did get a chance to read the [prologue of 等一个人咖啡](http://www.kanunu8.com/book3/7350/160103.html) yesterday, but I really just need to commit to a book to read to. There is also a book titled 家庭幸福的秘诀 that I picked up next to my local Ranch 99 supermarket. I used the GoogleDrive OCR(which is later mentioned in Discoveries) and have finished 1 page so far.
3.  **Work in Progress** Take and pass HSK 5 by October 2015 

    **Thoughts**: To date, I’ve taken a practice HSK 4 and a practice HSK 5 test back in march.
4. [Memorize HSK 5 Vocabulary](http://www.memrise.com/course/985/hsk-level-5/)
![2331 of 2620 words memorized on Memrise](/assets/img/memrise-hsk5-progress-9-13-2015.png)

    **Insights**: I’ll be updating this with some simple statistics about my rate of studying words for the past year.

5. **Pending** [Practical Audio Visual Reader](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Audio-Visual-Chinese-Book1~5-Edition/dp/B004TIXNLC): Based off of the curriculum offered by Taiwan’s [Mandarin Training Center](http://140.122.110.12/mtcweb/files/Class%20level_English.pdf), I thought it would be invaluable to learn up to volume three and four. Because the content is in traditional Chinese and wouldn’t match exactly the content for the HSK 5, I will probably start looking into this in November after taking the HSK 5 test.
    
    **Thoughts**: I’m still going to hold off until I pass the HSK 5.

6. **FAIL** Finish 100 intermediate lessons on [Chinesepod](https://chinesepod.com/) by September 2015
    **Thoughts** I listened to chinesepod in the background while at work, and I thought it was a lot of work to try to focus on the content. I’ve heard people listen to podcasts while commuting so I need to give this a try. What I like about the site is that there are so many topics covered and it gives me a lot of ideas to practice writing about.
7.  **FAIL** Complete all archived lessons on [slow-chinese](http://www.slow-chinese.com/) by June 2015.

    **Thoughts** I finished reading podcast 72 of 149 posts as of the time of this publishing.

# Discoveries
* Google Drive OCR: My strong preference for reading online text is tightly coupled with the ability to use a popup dictionary such as [ZhongWen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-a-chinese-englis/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde?hl=en) to get immediate translations. Read this [Google Drive OCR article by ChineseHacks](http://chinesehacks.com/resources/how-to-use-the-free-ocr-feature-in-google-docs/)
* [Memrise App Speed Review Mode for Android](http://feedback.memrise.com/knowledgebase/articles/621867-speed-review-explained-in-the-android-app): Originally on the Memrise Android app, the review mode was not time pressured, but now I can race against the clock to see how well I know my words. Also, 2600 HSK5 vocabulary list that I need to keep fresh, this allows me to review more words in less time.
* chinaSMACK: I arrived on this news site while browsing for [swear words](http://www.chinasmack.com/glossary). Some of their articles such as [Tibetan Mastiffs: From Guard Dogs to Status Symbols to Hot Pot](http://www.chinasmack.com/2015/stories/tibetan-mastiffs-from-guard-dogs-to-status-symbols-to-hot-pot.html) have accompanying original content and original comments in addition to the translations. The site is now following a digest format and not producing lengthy content, which resulted in an [uproar on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/32oqa5/what_is_happening_at_chinasmack/).
* [HanPing Chinese Popup for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embermitre.hanping.app.popup): Finally, a [popup tool for mobile phones](http://chinesehacks.com/resources/hanping-chinese-popup/). Alas, the app is not compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S4, but I’ll be sure to get it on my next phone upgrade.
* [ZhiHu (知乎)](http://www.zhihu.com/): Found this link on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/3kvgvb/found_an_excellent_resource_for_reading_practice/). Mandarin version of Quora

# Goal Revisions
My objective right now  is to be as prepared for the HSK 5 test within a month, so I am readjusting my goals for a stronger focus on the test and with tighter deadlines.

1. Review all 2600 words on memrise.
2. HSK 5 Mock Test 2 by 9/24
3. HSK 5 Mock Test 3 by 9/27
4. HSK 5 Mock Test 4 by 10/4
5. HSK 5 Mock Test 5 by 10/11
6. Keep with Slow Chinese just to get more chinese reading practice.
7. Review all the [B2 grammar points](http://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/B2_grammar_points). Go through [Memrise deck](http://www.memrise.com/course/129168/chinese-grammar-wiki-b2/). I chose B2 Grammar points based off of this [Common European Framework of Reference for Languages table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi#Estimates_of_equivalent_CEFR_levels)
