title:  "Impressions of Italki"
---
When I started this post-grad journey of learning mandarin, my brother told me that one of his friends started using [italki](http://www.italki.com) to schedule online classes with teachers.
After a month and a half of using italki, I wanted to share with you my impressions. I haven’t payed for any lessons yet, but have read a couple of [teachers articles](http://www.italki.com/articles),  written some [notebook entries](http://www.italki.com/user/1701796#notebook), and had 2 language exchange conversations and counting.

# Italki Incentives
[![Italki Gift Card](/assets/img/italki-gift-card.png)](http://www.italki.com/giftcards?utm_source=dashboardad&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=holidayseason2014)

Italki has created some incentives such as their gift cards, recent [language challenge](http://promos.italki.com/italki-2014-october-language-challenge/), referral credits, and non-redeemable italki points. I’ll briefly discuss about their credit and italki points, but I personally believe that the most attractive feature of the website is the language exchange network.

## Italki Points

### Italki Points &ne; ITC (ITalki Credits)

The first day I found italki, I was ecstatic that every notebook correction I made increased my italki points and I was expecting to reap the full benefits of the site (such as credit toward lessons) without paying. Wow, I thought to myself now that I have 500 or so Italki points within 2 days, how many lessons I can have? Upon further inspection and much to my dismay, I realized that [italki points](http://support.italki.com/entries/21629711-italki-Points-What-are-they-) have been an experimental feature for over 2 years and counting and my way to cope with this disappointment was to view the points as reputation points.

### Italki Points = "Reputation Points"
I believe that italki points are good insofar as identifying long-term members. Among some of the most prolific users among mandarin learners is [Jeff](http://www.italki.com/user/718609), and if I ever get a chance I would be more than curious on what gets him to contribute to the community on a consistent basis. I'm also curious italki points will be utilized in the future, but right now it’s just a cosmetic ego booster.

## A Big Win: Language Exchange
Virtual credits aside, what brings me back to the site is the language exchange network. I can find people who are also invested in learning languages!

# Notable Features

## Lessons: Yet to Try
Quite frankly, I haven’t tried this out yet, since I’m adamant about self-studying awhile for the HSK 5. I plan on [buying a mock test book](http://sarajaaksola.com/preparing-for-the-new-hsk-level-5-exam/) mentioned by a successful test taker and perusing the other [HSK resources mentioned by FluentU](http://www.fluentu.com/chinese/blog/2014/10/27/resources-prepare-mandarin-chinese-new-hsk-exam/). I do, however, appreciate that there are competitively priced trial lessons, and that the certified teachers do post their video introductions on to the page, so you can get a taste for their teaching style. After making your first purchase of ITC credits, you do get a [premium badge](http://www.italki.com/premium) on your profile, which seems to give your questions more prominence and notebook entries more prominence. By guesstimation, most of the pricing for chinese tutors are around $15 per hour of class. In college, we usually had 4 hours of discussion a week in addition to maybe 4 to 5 hours of homework a week, which could cost around $60 dollars a week.

## Notebook
I think this is a great idea for people to actually practice writing, but since I started using italki, I found another service called [lang-8.com](lang-8) which is primarily focused on writing. My initial posts was a translation for newspaper ad about a [Tea station](http://www.italki.com/entry/486319) and a news article Forbes magazine article about [job hunting for new grads](http://www.italki.com/entry/486835). I’ve gotten quality corrections both on italki and lang-8, except I have a strong hunch that longer writings (especially essays) are more suited for the lang-8 community. For example in my most recent post on my recent language learning methods, I received [3 revisions within the first 24 hours on lang-8](http://lang-8.com/1091561/journals/256231660350717783193269096223025204986) and [1 revision within the first hour on italki](http://www.italki.com/entry/499046). For now, I’m cross-posting on both platforms. On italki, it’s also interesting to see what people have posted as a way to see how other people your level write, and I was particularly intrigued by an opinion piece about [artificial intelligence （人工智能）](http://www.italki.com/entry/499122).

## Language Exchange
![Language Exchange search](/assets/img/italki-language-exchange-search.png)
This is the feature that I find the most exciting! The format I’ve been using so far is 1 hour language exchange with 1/2 english and 1/2 mandarin over skype.

### Speaking with Natives gets me excited about Language Learning
It’s very validating to be able to speak with a native speaker, because your language skills are put to the test. It's great because you don't have to worry about holding back and revising as you do when writing an essay or blog post, but rather the focus is to just generate a lot of speech, identity words that you wish you could say, and words that your partner says as well. Also, since the exchange is mutual beneficial, it's rewarding to know that someone else is benefiting from the exchange.

### Finding Language Partners is a Numbers Game. Follow up!
My goal right now is to get 2 to 4 language partners of both Taiwanese Chinese and Mainland Chinese background so that I can get accustomed to the ways that both accents of mandarin are spoken.
So far I’ve reached out to or have been contacted by 14 different potential language exchange partners or another. Some are either no longer active users or just gave me a virtual cold shoulder (I can’t tell the difference!), for others there may have been some initial interest but we hadn’t successful setup a meetup so nothing came to fruition.

### Coordinating Timezones
To accommodate a 9-6pm workday, I’ve proposed the following timeframes to propsective partners:

- 7am-8am PST / 11pm - 12am CST and Taiwan Time (Haven’t had any sessions at this time yet)
- 10pm-12am PST / 2pm - 4pm CST and Taiwan Time (Had 2 sessions and counting)

I’m very thankful that I’ve been able to find times at the 10pm PST timezone.

### The First Talk
I envisioned this to be pretty much like the 30 minute coffee that that many seekers probably have over the phone with recruiters, where you are trying to learn more about the persons background.
When I’m on the speaking side, I just try to generate different aspects about my life (why I learned chinese, my experience in Boy Scouts, etc). In my first two language exchanges, the person speaking the non-native language will probably spend most of the time talking. I want to get the conversation to the point where both partners are interacting fairly equally in the conversation, so that when the native-speaking partner is speaking, the non-native can practice listening comprehension.

### Keep it Casual
Are you enjoying yourself?

### Ask a lot of questions
Especially for speaking, I like to ask, how do you say “x”? Sometimes, when I can’t find the words to speak the sentence, I try to say what I want to say in broken chinese, then fluent english, and then my partner translates what I meant to say in Mandarin.

### Try not to make corrections unless prompted
I do this as a means of not interrupting the flow, and if I don’t quite understand what they are saying I try to rephrase what they say, upgrading vocabulary words from the original sentence if appropriate.


### Language Exchange Todos

#### Finding Topics to talk about after session 1
This will be interesting to see what types of topics, I will be talking with about with my language exchange partners after the first exchange and months down the road.  A quick google for “Language exchange topics” will probably produce quite a few results as well as this list of [32 topics](http://www.tobefluent.com/2014/09/02/language-exchange-so-what-do-you-want-to-talk-about/).

#### Recording Calls
With permission, I think it will be very cool to record the calls and see the results of our language exchange after a few months. Furthermore, audio recordings will allow me to review some of the topics we talked about.

# Precautions

## 3rd-party Accounts are publicly visible
At first I linked my facebook account, so I would only have one less password to memorize, but after I found out that my profile is linked on the italki page, I unlinked my account just as a precautionary measure for privacy.

#Summary
- Italki provides some incentives to save you a dollar such as their referral program, gift card deals, and language challenges.
- Among their features, my favorite is the Language Exchange network!

I'm curious how you have tailored your italki lessons (for HSK, Business Chinese, etc) and if you have any great stories about your language exchange experience.
