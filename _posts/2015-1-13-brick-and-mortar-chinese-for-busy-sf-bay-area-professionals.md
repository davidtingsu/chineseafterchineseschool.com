title:  "Brick and Mortar Chinese for busy SF Bay Area Professionals"
---
Before graduating college, I did a query for local private and public institutions to learn chinese that would be suitable for a 9-to-5er. Part of the reason why I’m self-studying for the [HSK 5](http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/hsk/hsklevel5.php), is because ultimately I wasn’t able to find a course for an advanced-intermediate chinese speaker seeking advanced proficiency. Nonetheless, I’m doing this writeup for busy working professionals who are not only considering courses and tutoring, but also activity based language groups such as toastmasters or meetups.

# Schools and Tutors

Firstly, most chinese language schools in the San Francisco Bay Area are listed on [wheretolearnchinese.com](http://www.wheretolearnchinese.com/component/jreviews/search-results/criteria:1/query:exact/jr_radius:5/jr_programsoffered:adult-education/order:rating.html), but many of the leads for adult education are for Chinese cultural classes.

## Community Colleges

California provides a listing of community colleges and you can filter it by [community colleges in the Bay Area](http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/maps/map.asp?x=36&y=6&address=City%2C+Zip+or+Address&major=By+Academic+Program&area=Bay+Area) and also filter by [academic programs](http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/maps/map.asp?x=28&y=4&address=City%2C+Zip+or+Address&major=Chinese+%28Foreign+Language%29+&area=Bay+Area#). However, just go through the schools one by one in your area, and check for chinese programs on the school website since the data for Chinese academic programs in the community college database appears to be out of date. For example, San Jose City College courses are ommitted from the search results and Foothill’s defunct chinese program still appears in the results.

## Universities
[Generate a shortlist of colleges by zipcode](http://youcango.collegeboard.org/college/locator/) and then find programs that offer open universities or have extension programs.
A shortlist includes [Stanford](https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/courses-by-department), [Berkeley](http://extension.berkeley.edu/public/category/programStream.do?method=load&selectedProgramAreaId=15497&selectedProgramStreamId=15595), and [SJSU](http://www.sjsu.edu/openuniversity/schedule/).


## Tutors & Others

### Confucius Institute
The [Confucius Institute (孔子学院) at SFSU](http://www.sfsu.edu/~ci/index.html) helps to administer HSK tests and also hosts classes.

### Defense Foreign Language Institute
In college, I had a chance to compete in the [CLTAC Speech Competion (演講比賽)](http://www.cltac.org/speech-contest.html), and when looking at past results and competitors in the high school divisions I came across  the [Defense Foreign Language Institute](http://www.dliflc.edu/faqs.html), which only offers courses to members of the armed forces.


### Craigslist
Besides buying house furniture, who knew [tutors advertised on craigslist?](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/lss?query=mandarin)

### Yelp
I tried “chinese language school” and “chinese tutor” as my search terms.

If your searching by cities, it’s impossible to find locations > 5 mile radius from your target city. My workaround was to [search by larger geographic regions](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=mandarin+tutor&find_loc=San+Francisco%2C+CA#find_loc=San+Francisco+Bay+Area,+CA)

Some interesting results produced included the [man who voices Rosetta stone lessons](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dennis-language-services-san-francisco), a [learning studio ran by a mom](http://www.yelp.com/biz/california-chinese-culture-learning-studio-san-francisco-2?hrid=XGVFF4A0_Y71qOTrPDOumg), and [a Spanish and Chinese school with a sleek website](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kaixin-language-school-san-francisco-2?hrid=dWeC38bZGt-hJX6g2jTCVQ).

### Wyzant
While running google queries for tutors, I kept on coming across [wyzant.com](http://wyzant.com). Rates tend to hover around $50/hr with the highest I encountered at $90/hr. If you are wary about wyzant as a company, you can read this [TechCrunch report about the company](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/16/wyzant-lands-21-5m-from-accel-to-take-its-tutoring-marketplace-global-and-mobile/).

# Language Meetups
I think find a group via [Chinese language Meetup Groups](http://chinese-language.meetup.com/) will put me in contact with local language enthusiasts and afford for me a chance to put practice into effect in an immersive environment. Understandably skill levels vary greatly, some organizers might also have additional motives to promote their language schools, but I can afford to take a breather and go out to meet people.

# Toastmasters
I have some enjoyed my past experience in toastmasters practicing public speaking and in the SF Bay Area and there are Mandarin-English toastmasters located in [San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/SF-MET/) and [Milpitas](http://www.meetup.com/MET-clubs/). Toastmasters usually start off giving speeches at 4 minutes and work their way up to longer times. There are also opportunities to talk for 1-2 minutes during table topic discussions. I don’t expect people to be correcting my grammar for speeches since speeches are usually roughly outlined before delivery and not fully written out, but I do hope to improve my chinese listening ability by recording native-Chinese speeches and listening to them until I comprehend them. I can also have a member record me and analyze where I can add more content to my speech.


# Bookstores
If you’re looking for books hot off the Chinese press, you may be surprised that there is a [budding online reading culture in China](http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/the-most-popular-books-in-china-and-why/32503). Combo the html-based book with a [pop-up dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-a-chinese-englis/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde?hl=en) and an audiobook (有聲讀物) from [ximalaya](http://www.ximalaya.com/), [kting.cn](http://www.kting.cn/), or [yousheng8](http://www.yousheng8.com/) and you may be in for reading nirvana. I have yet to complete a book with this method, but it appears promising. An italki friend recommended to me books written by [Giddens Ko](http://www.kanunu8.com/files/writer/189.html).

Nonetheless, with the proliferation of online bookstores and [hard-times for chinese bookstores](http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-chinese-bookstores-20141125-story.html), it’s sometimes refreshing to get my hands on a physical copy of the book before making a purchase.

I’ve only personally made a trip to [Eastwind Books of Berkeley](http://www.yelp.com/biz/eastwind-books-of-berkeley-berkeley-2) which has [partnerships with UC Berkeley](http://www.asiabookcenter.com/textbooks.html), and though their collection for bilingual books is small (I could only find Pride and Prejudice), what struck me was their collection of books pertaining to Asian American studies, a topic I haven’t really read into but it may be worth reading for leisure.

On my to-do list is to visit:

- [Chinabooks](http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-books-south-san-francisco): Has a large collection of books including the [New Practical Chinese Reader Series](http://www.chinabooks.com/product-category/chinese-text3/k8textbooks/new-practical-chinese-reader-series/), which I came across on the web.
- [Eastwind Books - unrelated to Berkeley Eastwind](http://www.yelp.com/biz/eastwind-books-and-arts-san-francisco-3): Has a collection of traditional chinese books in addition to simplified chinese. Also, some of the books may appeal to the young adult.

Some other mentions:

- [Soyodo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/soyodo-millbrae): There appears to a few stores in California named Soyodo, though they don’t appear to have any relation to each other. This store also does double duty as a computer repair store.
- [Nanhai Books](http://www.yelp.com/biz/nan-hai-bookstore-santa-clara): Apparently the same address also belongs to the [Hanban Chinese Online Testing Center](http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/hsk/hsktestcenter_pacific.php)


# Calculations

So as a 9-to-5-er I’ll probably have about 3-4 hours of expendable time each weekday. In actuality, my timeline will look more like 8am to 8:00pm since I anticipate work to end at 6-7pm, and adding about an 1 hour of padding on either side of the timeframe for commute.

Therefore, I’m looking for either nightly classes or weekend classes. Although [Kaixin School](http://kaixinlanguageschool.com/programs/kaixin-mandarin/) does have some weekend classes and I was able to find nightly classes at [Diablo Valley College](http://www3.dvc.edu/org/info/schedules/course-detail.htm?keySection=8082Spring2015Chinese), both of them appear to be out of my current scope for advanced-intermediate chinese learners. Coupled with the 30min+ commute from the South Bay, I have extra disincentive to take these courses.

Perhaps the greatest realization of as an ex-student, is that you soon realize that **a large portion of learning comes from self-studying** and finding help by way of professors, TAs (Teaching Assistants), or other peers. I’m also not expecting taking a class to render my a fluent mandarin speaker, otherwise, I wouldn’t still be blogging here today in spite of receiving mandarin education since I could remember.

I do plan on trying out a toastmaster, a meetup, and plan to take the HSK in March 2015 before considering to get a tutor if I don’t pass.

Should I consider paying for a class, I will ask for a diagnostic test, a trial lesson, sample coursework, class expectations, and a referral that I could talk to before I consider spending.

# Conclusion

My ultimate conclusion after doing a survey of brick and mortar chinese language schools, is that **in the San Francisco Bay Area there are no mandarin courses for the advanced-intermediate chinese learner and working professional** (In my terms, an advanced-intermediate is equivalent to HSK 4 aptitude and completion of 3rd year university classes). As a 9-to-5er, I am left with the choice to either self-study or call it quits and go back to schooling.

Since all this is but a hobby, I’m choosing  to take the self-study route! Stay tuned for monthly language goals and my current learning methodologies!
