### HSK Exam
![SFSU Campus](/assets/img/SFSU_Campus.jpg)

Unfortunately, I was involved in a minor traffic incident that prevented me from taking care of the test. 
My overall mood during the day was a concoction of test anxiety and also excitement - anxious that I didn’t feel fully prepared and that I had difficulty completing the reading portions on the test exams, but at the same time eager to see just how much I improved over the last year.

## OpenLanguage Tudou Channel

Although [Jenny Zhu](http://jennyzhu.com/) and much of the [original team left Chinesepod](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/2razdb/all_of_the_original_chinesepod_team_are_gone/), she maintains a Tudou channel called [OpenLanguage](http://www.tudou.com/home/_119396439), which has been dormant as of late, but I’m hoping that it still remains active.


## Italki Beta Facelift

It’s invigorating to see the repolish of the [beta italki website](https://beta.italki.com/) and although there are some feature gaps, I’m expecting more things in store.

## Chinese Hacks November Writing Challenge
I wanted to jumpstart my writing again and my italki journal was suffering from the winter cold, so 
I was attracted to the idea of being publically accountable for my studies and I signed up for the [November Writing Challenge](http://challenges.hackingchinese.com/challenges/23-writing-challenge-november-2015). Alas, I fell short of my commitment of 4 hours with zero hours. If you’re looking for other chinese challenges, you might also want to consider the [Italki Language Challenges](http://www.italki.com/languagechallenge).

## Hacking Chinese: A Practical Guide to Learning Mandarin

I haven’t had a chance to check out this study strategies course that I received via email on 12/15/2015, but I would imagine it might be useful for people who are self-studying and are not currently doing formal training. Priced at $97 for a limited time and a 30 day money-back guarantee.

> The course is for beginners, intermediate and advanced learners alike. It provides the overall structure the website lacks and helps you connect the dots. Through practical exercises and demonstrations, I also encourage you to take action and improve the way you learn right now!

_You can dock the screen reader to the notification screen. Pressing the stacked papers icon converts the screen into plain text. To exit out of plain text mode, you can scroll down the page in your app to redraw the page or alternatively long press and click ‘Send to Pleco Screen Reader’ (where you can also read the text) and then on the Galaxy S6 I press the Recent Apps buton and return to my application._

The pleco screen reader does work out of the box with the pleco app, but after some usage, I decided in favor of Hanping Popup. Yes it does appear to work fine on WeChat and although I do prefer the pleco dictionary over the hanping dictionary, the screen reader “plain-textifies” the app so that to look like text in a word document. Also, I have not found a way to undo the screen read operation to transform from the plain text view back to the original look. However, I might still keep the screen reader app around because it does make fairly easy to jump from phrases to phrases without needing to move your finger around the screen for hanping popup.

## Hanping Popup ($9.99)

### Analysis
After discovering 
 [Hanping Chinese Popup for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.embermitre.hanping.app.popup) in [my previous blog post]({% post_url 2015-09-18-ramping-up-for-hsk-5 %}#discoveries) I upgraded to a Galaxy S6, and finally got to test it out.

This is the only popup dictionary I have seen and only supports android. The green/white popup cursor about as large as [facebook messenger chat heads](https://www.facebook.com/help/android-app/101495056700254?rdrhc). You can toggle the cursor by toggling the notifications and pressing the toggle button to hide/show the cursor.

![Toggle Hanping](/assets/img/toggle-hanping.gif)
_Toggle the visibility of the hanping popup cursor from the notifications screen or directly from the Hanping Popup app._

#### Cons 
 
Regarding cons, I encountered incorrect character recognition before, but very rarely. Since it uses hanping dictionary and I only have the lite version installed on my phone, when I open the popup to see a more detailed information about the character, there are only english translations. A workaround is to click the copy button on the popup and paste the definition into pleco.

## OCR (Wishlist)

Purchasing a screen reader fromt the developer of hanping, made me look further into OCR apps, which I may consider using in the future if I am reading a textbook, but since I mostly consume mandarin on the web or on mobile apps, so I don’t see an urgent need for an OCR. If you are on a tight wallet, it is also possible to [scan documents and convert the text in google drive](http://chinesehacks.com/resources/how-to-use-the-free-ocr-feature-in-google-docs/).

Based off of the below demo videos and the [ocr faceoff article](http://chinesehacks.com/resources/how-to-use-the-free-ocr-feature-in-google-docs/), I will most likely purchase hanping’s dictionary in the future for the support of multiple definitions displayed at once.

> [Regarding Pleco OCR] Only one definition is displayed at a time, making longer sentences tedious to translate.

# Summary
Overall, although I have not been as rigorous about studying, I am excited about how hanping popup dictionary can enable to me to learn chinese more on a casual level when I’m reading my friend’s chinese posts on facebook or wechat (微信), or browsing content on weibo or zhihu. Furthermore, with the slick re-design of italki, I’m excited to get my partner sessions back on track and contribute more to my [italki notebook](http://www.italki.com/user/1701796#notebook). 

In order to still get exposure to chinese, I also have watched movies on youku, some of which have chinese and english subtitles, and I have also completed the idol drama  [My Best Ex-Boyfriend - 最佳前男友](https://www.viki.com/tv/28818c-my-best-ex-boyfriend).

I will resume completing the last 140 words in the HSK 5 list and will be deciding on a date for the HSK retake soon.
