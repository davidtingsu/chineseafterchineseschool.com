author-bio: "ChineseAfterChineseSchool is about an American Born Chinese guy's journey to comprehend and wrestle the mandarin language after graduating college with an unrelated degree. 
The blog gets it name as a homage to the weekly after-school chinese school that was formative to this guy's secondary language acquisition that he attended until the 8th grade, a period of sweat, tears, and hand-holding."
